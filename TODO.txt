1. when the screen is small remove the left margin and the right margins from the outgoings and the incomings

Questions
- should I make an api if I want to make my app usable by many users and add a database?



TODOs:
- set up the module pattern
- set up event listners for adding a new bill - open the input modal
- read input data from the modal 
- create a init function
- create income and expense function constructors in the data handling module

- don't allow empty fields in the input of new bills or 0 as the amount (less 85.)

issues:
- adding event listener on enter press in my modal so it runs ctrlAddItem()


Log in :
- google log in apis

TODO:
- change colour back to green if total goes back to 0 or above 
- style the tables
- add DB access
- add option for other currencies
- add edit capabilites to the entries in the table 
    - add event listener to open modal when the edit button is pressed
    - get the data form the modal and pass it to the edit method in the controller whihc passes it to the data module and the UI
    - in the edit modals set the text to be the current item's values for name description and amount then the user can change them if they want by deleting them so get the parent element of the edit button? and grab the info like that?
- add placeholder for when there are no bills to show
- don't allow non numbers and strings in the amount fields
- don't allow empty fields 
- add items to the table is highest to lower cost order or add option in the select that is inputted order

- add categorisation to the expenses and incomes 
- Generate monthly reports based on the inputs and write custom alerts for things, like, “spending too much money on food as always.”

- wrap text on decription in the tables  OR set max characters
